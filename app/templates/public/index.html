        <p class="lead">Image inpainting is the task of filling holes in an image, this can be used in various aspects
            of image processing. One can remove unwanted parts of the image while keeping the integrity of the image
            intact. Image inpainting presents a lot of implications in real life, such as recovery of a lossy image
            after transmission, different varieties of image/painting restorations.

            A few solutions for achieving the results have been
            developed, some of the solutions are based on methods based on n wavelet representation of images,
            variational analysis, structural features, interpolation models, etc. However, most of these traditional
            methods rely heavily on rectangle shaped regions near the centre of the image and expensive post-processing.

            Traditional methods use Conv2D layers built in keras for this task, which often leads to colour discrepancy
            and blurriness. The task at hand is to remove the need of expensive post-processing and blending operations,
            while dealing with irregular holes/masks robustly and produce a meaningful and semantically correct image.
            For this purpose, we thought of removing the convoluted layers by replacing them with partially convoluted
            layers and mask-updates.
